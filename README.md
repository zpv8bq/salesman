To use the TSP solver execute python3 tsp_solver.py <input_file> where input_file is one of the provided cities__.dat. This program will output the annealing schedule and the best_route in a new file called cities##_solution.dat, which is then run by the routeplot, such as python3 routeplot.py <cities##_solution.dat>, which plots the best_route on the map in a PDF. 

- cities150 <331200.86 km> <48356.92 km> <60.78 seconds>
- cities1k <2786499.70 km> <103417.20 km> <99.05 seconds>

The tsp_solver.py program uses two methods. One is the reverse segment, which selects two random positions in the route and reverses the order of the cities between them. The second method is the swapping place method. The code generates two random numbers that locate two cities and swap positions with each other. The reverse segment is used 87.5% of the time, and the swap place method is used the rest of the time. This was done by trial and error, of manually changing the percentages and seeing how the improvement percentage changes. The metropolis criterion is then used to accept or reject the new route, which depends on whether the distance shortens or the probability is accepted, even though sometimes the distance does not shorten. Afterwards, the temperature is reduced exponentially by alpha, which, depending on the number of cities, varies to produce an efficient code. For the 150 cities, I found that alpha was best set at 0.9998, and for 1k cities, alpha was best at 0.9999. The iterations were then set to 75 for 150 cities and to 50 for 1k cities. These iterations provided a more reasonable run time for each data set. The T inital was automated depending on the dL_max found in a sample of 100 distances calculated.The T_init was then set to 2*dL_max.
